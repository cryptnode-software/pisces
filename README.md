# Livs Cookie Co

Livs Cookie Co is a open source template that can be used to create your own e-commerce store. This should require all the basic neccesities that are
required to properly start and run your online store. This was a project that I started for a friend that I decided to make open source to provide
the fundamental building blocks to start your own.
